Hi, I'm Alexia!

I started my journey to become a frontend developer in late September 2024.
Since then, I’ve been learning through the Foundation
course from The Odin Project. While I’m not a professional yet, I’m passionate about building my skills and working on
projects that help me grow as a developer. Thank you for checking out my work!</p>
